# tpp
Textual Post Processing for projects is an open source utility for applying validations and automated changes to text, mainly targeting projects of code.

tpp is written with NodeJS for backend and ReactJS for the frontend.

Users define rules for their project, such as "replace occurrences of X with Y", or "require manual confirmation for occurrences of TODO". They upload project files when they want them processed and then get a link for the amended files.
